# MyMeshViewer
The Mesh Viewer is an easy to use lightweight application for displaying three dimensional models (triangle meshes). It uses OpenGL to render the models. In this assignment, you are given several 3D models in Hugues Hoppeâ€™s M file format. Triangle meshes can be displayed solid, as a wire frame (all lines or just front lines), or as point clouds. The surface normals of the triangles can be displayed optionally. Loaded models can be rotated, translated and scaled (all done with the mouse). The model is lit by one or multiple light sources. Users can also change the type of the projection (orthogonal projection and perspective projection).
